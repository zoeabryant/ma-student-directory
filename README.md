Student Directory
=================

First project at Makers Academy is to create a list of students on our course, and handle that data.

### Day 1 - directory.rb
First attempt at coding with Hannah! We ask for names and put them into a nice array and output them onto the screen. We try a few different ways of doing this as we progress through the lesson. We bother a lot of people for their names and hobbies so we have an accurate data set to start with.

### Day 2 - directory2.rb
New day, new partner - Charlotte! We start again, using the best of both our programmes from yesterday. We add an interactive menu, prompting users to choose what they want to do. We explore saving the data to a csv file. Along the way we constantly refactor our code to make it as neat as possible.

How to use
----------
```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
(directory[DAY NUMBER].rb)
