## Student Directory

First project at Makers Academy is to create a list of students on our course, and handle that data.
Started this on Day 2 of Makers Academy. Day count is by number of days on this specific project.

Quality control - [Reeks](https://github.com/joenas/preek) . There are plenty of code smells in this project. Good thing it was the first week at makers! See how my code was at the end? [Recreating instagram](https://github.com/zoeabryant/ma-ruby-challenge) or [in my final project](https://github.com/HanWax/so_close).


## Day by day breakdown
Providing an overview of how I progressed on the project each day.

### Day 1 - directory.rb
First attempt at coding with Hannah [- HanWax](https://github.com/HanWax)! We ask for names and put them into a nice array and output them onto the screen. We try a few different ways of doing this as we progress through the lesson. We bother a lot of people for their names and hobbies so we have an accurate data set to start with.

### Day 2 - directory2.rb
New day, new partner - Charlotte [- cmew3](https://github.com/cmew3)! We start again, using the best of both our programmes from yesterday. We add an interactive menu, prompting users to choose what they want to do. We explore saving the data to a csv file. Along the way we constantly refactor our code to make it as neat as possible. We also have an excersize in which we have to fix code (codetofix.rb)

### Day 3 - directory3.rb and directory3-with-CSV-library.rb
Day 3 coding with Dave [- Bayonnaise](https://github.com/Bayonnaise)! We start again, trying to make the most efficent version of the programme. We explore file saving and loading, including going on a slight tangent adding functionality that checks if a file exists before trying to load / save. We made a version that uses the CSV library to explore both.

### Day 4 - directory4.rb
Day 4 we are focussing on something other than student directory. I'm paired with Toan [- yoshdog](https://github.com/yoshdog), who showed me how to use the Date object to check months and sort the students by cohort so I could make this version awesome.

### Day 5 - directory5/
Introduction to TDD - Test Driven Development - Is a rocky one. I'm paired with Catharina [- CatharinaLD](https://github.com/CatharinaLD) and we work through the basics of rspec.

### Day 6 - directory6/
TDD we meet again, this time with Jenny [- thejennywang](https://github.com/thejennywang). Started from scratch and built up our tests again, graduating to checking CSV files with doubles and using lets and before methods.

### Day 7 - directory7/
Working with Iona [- ionaselig](https://github.com/ionaselig), tackling rspec again...

### Day 8 - directory8/
Working with Joe [- joedowdell](https://github.com/joedowdell). Final showdown on understanding rspec.
