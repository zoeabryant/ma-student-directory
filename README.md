Student Directory
=================

First project at Makers Academy is to create a list of students on our course, and handle that data.

### Day 1 - directory.rb
First attempt at coding with Hannah (@HanWax)! We ask for names and put them into a nice array and output them onto the screen. We try a few different ways of doing this as we progress through the lesson. We bother a lot of people for their names and hobbies so we have an accurate data set to start with.

### Day 2 - directory2.rb
New day, new partner - Charlotte (@cmew3)! We start again, using the best of both our programmes from yesterday. We add an interactive menu, prompting users to choose what they want to do. We explore saving the data to a csv file. Along the way we constantly refactor our code to make it as neat as possible. We also have an excersize in which we have to fix code (codetofix.rb)

### Day 3 - directory3.rb and directory3-with-CSV-library.rb
Day 3 coding with Dave (Bayonnaise)! We start again, trying to make the most efficent version of the programme. We explore file saving and loading, including going on a slight tangent adding functionality that checks if a file exists before trying to load / save. We made a version that uses the CSV library to explore both.

How to use
